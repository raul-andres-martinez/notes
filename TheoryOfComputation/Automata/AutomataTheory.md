# Formal Definition
## Alphabet
An alphabet is a finite set of elements called *symbols*. It is usually represented by Greek letters.
Examples:

Σ = {0, 1}
Σ1 = {a, b, ..., z}
Γ = {#, a1, bd} - This is valid, but not recommended.

Given a set Σ, a string (over Σ) is a sequence x1, x2, ..., xn, where xi ∈ Σ for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, which is a finite sequence of symbols. Strings are usually represented by lowercase Greek letters.
